    This function RETURNS A STRING.
    This function scans the word letter by letter.
    First, make sure word is uppercase, and all letters are uppercase.
    If the letter of the word is in the list of letters, keep it.
    Otherwise, replace it with an underscore (_).

    DO NOT USE PRINT!

    Example:
    >>> show_letters_in_word("VANCOUVER", ["A", "V"])

    >>> show_letters_in_word("TIM", ["G", "V"])
    '_ _ _'

    Runs the game. Allows for "turns" loops (attempts).
    At each turn:
    1. Ask the user for a letter
    2. Add the letter to the list of letters already tried by the player
    3. If the letter was already tried, ask again
    4. Use the show_letters_in_word function to display hints about the word
    5. Remove 1 to the number of tries left
    6. Check if the player
        - won (= word has been found)
        - lost (= word has not been found, no tries left)

    Do not forget to pick a random word first :-)
